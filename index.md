# Understanding ECMAScript 2015

ECMAScript is the name of the official JavaScript standard that JavaScript
runtimes implement, there's this whole trademark issue with Sun (Oracle) having
a trademark on the name "Java" and therefore also on the name "JavaScript". So
when the time came to standardize the language ECMAScript was chosen because
it's the standards organization that created the standard. The two terms are
essentially interchangable and referring to the same thing.

ECMAScript 6 is the sixth edition of this specification which was rattified and
completed in 2015, this version of the standard specification has also gone for
a long time under the name ECMAScript 6, which was it's working name for a long
time during the standardization process but in the end the technical committee
decided to break the prior naming convention and go ahead with ECMAScript 2015.

EMCAScript 2015 is by far the most feature packed revision to date, this guide
covers most of the new language features, changes and library additions made in
this version of the specification.
